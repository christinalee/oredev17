# oredev17
Material for Oredev 17 Kotlin Talk

A subset of this material was previously presented at DroidCon NYC '17 and Kotlin Conf '17 with Huyen. 
This expands those 20 minute presentations into a full length talk. New content: platform types and
(some) inlining.

This code was presented in IntelliJ because it purposefully contains lint warnings and errors
important to understanding the content. Viewing it online is probably a bad idea, as there is no
visual indication of which parts are the broken code and which parts are the working code, but like
covariance, I am not here to protect you from yourself, so read these in whatever reading tool you wish :)

P.S. The ASCII art looks better in the IDE.
